# pyMOU
#### Light package for simulation and connectivity estimation using the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (MOU)


This Python library relies on the MOU process to simulate network activity and estimate connectivity from observed activity (Gilson et al. PLoS Comput Biol 2016).
It is a collaborative effort between Andrea Insabato, Gorka Zamora-LÃ²pez and Matthieu Gilson.

## Quick install using pip

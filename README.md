#### Light package for simulation and connectivity estimation using the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (MOU)
#### THE PACKAGE HAS BEEN MOVED TO https://github.com/mb-BCA/pyMOU


This Python library relies on the MOU process to simulate network activity and estimate connectivity from observed activity (Gilson et al. *PLoS Comput Biol* 2016).

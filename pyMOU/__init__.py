Whole-brain effective connectivity estimator
============================================

A package to estimate whole-brain effective connectivity. blah, blah, blah ...

The package consists of ... Modules:

wbec
    Core module. Defines class ..., ... , ...
tools
    Diverse helper functions.


Using WBEC
-----------

To be written ... Provide examples of how to load the library and it's structure

Data I/O
--------

To be written ...

Since GAlib is based on NumPY arrays, saving and reading of adjacency matrices,
as well as any other output of GAlib functions, can be performed using the
usual data I/O functionalities of NumPy. See for example the NumPY
documentation for functions: ``loadtxt()``, ``savetxt()``, ``load()``,
``save()`` and ``savez()``.

Further information
-------------------

To see the list of all functions available within each module, use the
standard help in an interactive session, e.g.,  ::

>>> import galib
>>> help(galib.metrics)
>>> import galib.models as gam
>>> help(gam)

Same, to find further details of every function within each module:, e.g.,  ::

>>> help(galib.metrics.Degree)
>>> help(gam.ScaleFreeGraph)

In the IPython interactive session or in a Jupyter Notebook, help is requested
by typing the module of function name, and adding an interrogation mark, e.g., ::

>>> galib.metrics?
>>> gam.ScaleFreeGraph?
